This is an application designed to let players pick an NFL team followed by any NFL player. after they pick a player they are prompted to guess wether or not that NFL player has committed any crimes or not. after answering the prompt you will then be given an answer based on wether or not you were correct and if the player has been convicted of any crimes their most recent one along with some of the details will be given to you.

this was not made using any major frameworks and used only HTML, CSS, and Javascript code along with having only a front end and no back end
